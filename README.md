# Hair Salon 

#### Epicodus Week 3 C# Independent Projecct 

#### by Marguerite Kennedy

## Description

This is an MVC web application for a fictioanl hair salon. The "owner" will be able to add a list of the stylists, and for each stylist, add clients who see that stylist. The stylists work independently, so each client only belongs to a single stylist.

The user, a hypothetical owner/administrator of a salon, will be able to:
* select a stylist, see their details, and see a list of all clients that belong to that stylist.
* add new stylists to the system when hired.
* add new clients to a specific stylist. 
* In this salon, a client cannot be added without a stylist, and a client can't belong to more than one stylist, creating a "one to many" relationship. 

## Known Bugs
* None currently known. 

## Technologies Used (in initial phase)
  * C# 
  * MySql
  * Bootstrap
  * .NET framework
  * MSTest
